The web cookbook that doesn't suck.

## Publishing your recipe

Send a git patch with your recipe and if it's (not bloated) fine I'll merge it.
Every recipe is kept in its one folder under the `content/recipes/` directory.
The name of the directory should be the approx date you submit your recipe
followed by the name/slug of the recipe. 

For more information read
[http://saucesource.cc/about/](http://saucesource.cc/about/)

Take a look at the `content/recipes/` directory for examples of recipes and how
to format them.

## TODO

* Add dark pallet using prefers-color-scheme
* Finish Russian and Spanish translations
* Maybe add some kind of search functionality on the backend
* Maybe add some way to categorize recipes
