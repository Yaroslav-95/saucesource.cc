A recipe that's easy and fast to prepare (I think I've said this too many times
already). You can have this as a side dish, or for breakfast. Well, you can have
it whenever and wherever you want if you are cooking it! We are grown ups here
after all.

ingredients. The quantities are for one average hungry student. If you want to
have it as a side dish this should be enough for two persons.

2. Add some butter to a frying pan and heat up.
3. Add potatoes to frying pan, salt them and fry over medium heat for about

   ground pepper on top.
