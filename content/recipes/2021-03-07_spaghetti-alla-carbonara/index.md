![Spaghetti alla carbonara](carbonara.jpg)

I don't know many pasta or spaghetti recipes, but this is definitely one of my
favorite. You don't need many ingredients to cook it, and it is very fast and
easy to cook. This is of course not the "original" version, but rather my own
version of the dish. I do believe it is still quite delicious.

The main difference is that the original recipe uses pancetta (a type of Italian
salami). However, since nobody sells that where I live, I use bacon, which is
the next best thing (and because I love bacon). I also add some sour cream to
the egg mix to make the sauce more creamy, but you can forgo that if you'd like.

## Ingredients

Here is the ingredient list for about two adult-sized portions.

_Edit: I used to make this by using whole eggs, but since I've found that it
turns out more delicious and creamier if you only use the yolks._

* ~~2 eggs~~ 5 egg yolks
* 250g spaghetti
* 6-8 bacon stripes
* ½ - 1 tablespoon sour cream (optional)
* Some Parmigiano (Parmesan cheese)
* Salt
* Black pepper
* Olive oil

## Instructions

1. Boil some water in a pot and add some salt to it. After the water has begun
   to boil add the spaghetti and cook it al dente.
2. Cut the bacon stripes and fry them on a frying pan over medium heat.
3. While the spaghetti and the bacon are being cooked, prepare the sauce. Beat
   the yolks in a bowl and add a spoonful of sour cream. Add salt and pepper
   to taste. Shred the Parmesano and add it to the sauce mix. How much Parmesano
   you want to add depends on your taste, I like to add as much Parmesano as
   about half the volume of the egg mix (i.e. plenty).
4. Once the spaghetti is done, drain it, add some olive oil to the frying pan
   with the bacon, and add the spaghetti to the frying pan. Sauté for about 3
   minutes over medium-low heat.
5. Turn off the flame (very important) and add the egg and cheese sauce to the
   pan and mix thoroughly.
6. Serve and enjoy!
